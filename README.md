# MEI language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to MEI files in Atom and provides the `mei-all.rng` schema for validation and autocomplete with the [linter-autocomplete-jing](https://github.com/aerhard/linter-autocomplete-jing) package.

Originally copied from the [XML language package](https://github.com/atom/language-xml).

Additional MEI-specific features will (probably) be added in the future.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
